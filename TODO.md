We're going to implement authentication with Lucia

 Create tables for auth
 Setup drizzle driver with Lucia
 Setup google oauth (once u get the part where u need secrets just dm me for them)
 Create components for sign in and sign out (just keep them on the home page as buttons until we move them to a header)
This will require you to google and read thru documentation, but feel free to dm me if you're stuck anywhere
